# 🧩 Algorithms, Procedural Problem Solving & SQL Queries

This repository is a collection of **C++ algorithmic problems** and **SQL challenges**, all solved in a **procedural style**.  
Each problem is broken down into **small, reusable functions** or **queries** to promote **clarity and modular thinking**.  

The repo is divided into three major areas:  
1. C++ **Algorithms & Utilities** (arrays, strings, dates, math problems)  
2. Procedural **file-based database system** (simulating SQL logic)  
3. **SQL Query Problems** (joins, aggregations, grouping, etc.)
